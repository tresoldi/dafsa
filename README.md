DAFSA is a library for computing [Deterministic Acyclic Finite State Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_acyclic_finite_state_automaton) (also known as "directed acyclic word graphs", or DAWG). DAFSA are data structures derived from [tries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) that allow to represent a set of sequences (typically character strings or *n*-grams) in the form of a directed acyclic graph with a single source vertex (the `start` symbol of all sequences) and at least one sink edge (`end` symbols, potentially shared by one or more sequences). In the current implementation, sinks
are expressed by a trait of nodes, indicating that the node might or might not
be a sink.

The primary difference between DAFSA and tries is that suffix and infix redundancy is eliminated in the latter, as in the example of Figure 1 (from the linked Wikipedia article) storing the set of strings `"tap"`, `"taps"`, `"top"`, and `"tops"`. Even though DAFSAs cannot be used to store precise frequency information, given that terminal nodes can be reached by multiple paths, they still allow to estimate the sampling frequency; being acyclic, they can also reject any sequence not included in the training. Fuzzy extensions will allow to estimate the sampling probability of unobserved sequences.

![Trie vs. DAFSA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tresoldi/dafsa/master/doc/trie-vs-dafsa.png)

This data structure is a special case of a finite state recognizer that acts as a deterministic finite state automaton, as it recognizes all and only the sequences it was built upon. Mostly used in computer science for the space-efficient storage of sets of sequences without common compression techniques, such as dictionary or entropy types, or without probabilistic data structures, such as Bloom filters, the automata generated by this library are intended for linguistic exploration, and extend published models by allowing to approximate probability of random observation by carrying information on the weight of each graph edge.

## Installation

In any standard Python environment, `dafsa` can be installed with:

```
pip install dafsa
```

## How to use

The library offers a `DAFSA` object that can be used to compute an automaton, with methods for checking a sequence acceptance and for exporting the graph. A minimal usage is shown here:

```python
>>> import dafsa
>>> d = dafsa.DAFSA(["tap", "taps", "top", "tops", "dibs"])
>>> print(d)
DAFSA with 7 nodes and 8 edges (5 sequences)
  +-- #0: 0(#1:<d>/1|#5:<t>/4) [('t', 5), ('d', 1)]
  +-- #1: n(#2:<i>/1) [('i', 2)]
  +-- #2: n(#3:<b>/1) [('b', 3)]
  +-- #3: n(#4:<s>/3) [('s', 4)]
  +-- #4: F() []
  +-- #5: n(#6:<a>/2|#6:<o>/2) [('o', 6), ('a', 6)]
  +-- #6: n(#3:<p>/4) [('p', 3)]
```

Note how the resulting graph includes the 5 training sequences, with one starting node (#0) that advances with either a `t` (observed four times) or a `d` symbol (observed a single time), a subsequent node to `t` that only advances with `a` and `o` symbols (#1), and so on.

The visualization is much clearer with a graphical representation:

```python
>>> d.graphviz_output("example.png")
```

![First example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tresoldi/dafsa/master/doc/example.png)

**A DAFSA object allows to check for the presence or absence of a sequence in its structure, returning a terminal node if a path can be found:**

```python
>>> d.lookup("tap")
F(#4:<s>/3)
>>> d.lookup("tops")
F()
>>> d.lookup("tapap") is None
True
>>> d.lookup("ta") is None
True
```

A command-line tool for reading files with lists of strings, with one string per line, is also available:

```
$ cat resources/dna.txt
CGCGAAA
CGCGATA
CGGAAA
CGGATA
GGATA
AATA

$ dafsa resources/dna.txt -t png -o dna.png
```

Which will produce the following graph:

## Changelog

Version 0.2:
  - Added support for weighted edges and nodes
  - Added DOT export and Graphviz generation
  - Refined minimization method, which can be skipped if desired (resulting
    in a standard trie)
  - Added examples in the resources, also used for test data

Version 0.1:

  - First public release.

## Roadmap

Version 0.3:

  - Add support for non-character tokens, allowing to use any Python
    iterable as long as its elements are hasheable
  - Start integration with `networkx`, including:
    - Exporting DAFSA in standard network formats
    - Computation of shortest or *k*-shortest paths, along with
      cumulative edge and/or node weights
  - Preliminary generation of minimal regular expressions matching the
    contents of a DAFSA
  - Allow to join attributes in single sub-paths
  - Allow to replace final nodes with edges to ``end-of-sequence``
    nodes (possibly as a default)

Version 0.4:
  - Work on options for nicer graphviz output (colors, widths, etc.)
  - Decide how (and if) to properly implement a `.__gt__()` method for
    the nodes, both before and after the final minimization

Before 1.0:
  - Add code for Daciuk's packages in an extra directory, along with
    notes on license

## Alternatives

The main alternative to this library is the `dawg` one, available at [https://github.com/pytries/DAWG](https://github.com/pytries/DAWG). `dawg` is bundled with the `dwagdic` C++ library, and is intended to production usage of DAFSAs as a space-efficient data structure. It does not support the computation of edge weights, nor it is intended for exporting the internal structure as a graph.

Other alternatives are the `adfa` and `minim` packages, writting in C/C++, written by Jan Daciuk. The personal webpage hosting them has been offline for years, with a version at the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531133017/http://galaxy.eti.pg.gda.pl/katedry/kiw/pracownicy/Jan.Daciuk/personal/minim.html) available. Note that the archived version does *not* include the packages.
